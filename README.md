**Blog Preview Card**
=====================

**Description**
---------------

This is a HTML and CSS implementation of a blog preview card, featuring a unique design with a combination of rectangles, paths, and masks. The card displays a title, description, author name, and publication date.

**Technologies Used**
--------------------

* **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the card
* **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout of the card
* **SVG**: Used for creating the complex background image of the card

**HTML Structure**
-----------------

The HTML structure consists of a single `div` element with the class `card`, which contains three main sections:

### `blog-img`

A container for the SVG image that makes up the background of the card.

### `content`

A container for the text content of the card, including the title, description, and publication date.

### `author`

A container for the author's information, including their name and image.

**CSS Styles**
-------------

The CSS styles are defined in an external stylesheet (`style.css`) and are used to customize the appearance of the card. The styles include:

* Layout and positioning for the card and its components
* Colors and backgrounds for the card and its components
* Typography and font styles for the text content
* Custom styles for the SVG image and its components

**SVG Image**
-------------

The SVG image is a complex design that uses a combination of rectangles, paths, and masks to create a unique visual effect. The image is defined in the `blog-img` container and is styled using CSS.

**Author Image**
----------------

The author image is a separate image file (`img/Screenshot 2024-09-19 070525.png`) that is displayed in the `author` container.

**Customization**
----------------

To customize the appearance of the card, you can modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. You can also replace the author image with your own image file.
